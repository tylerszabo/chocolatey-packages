    <summary>A powerful duplicate file finder and an enhanced fork of 'fdupes'.</summary>
    <description>
jdupes is a program for identifying and taking actions upon duplicate
files. This fork known as 'jdupes' is heavily modified from and improved
over the original. See CHANGES for details.

A WORD OF WARNING: jdupes IS NOT a drop-in compatible replacement for
fdupes! Do not blindly replace fdupes with jdupes in scripts and expect
everything to work the same way. Option availability and meanings differ
between the two programs. For example, the -I switch in jdupes means
"isolate" and blocks intra-argument matching, while in fdupes it means
"immediately delete files during scanning without prompting the user."

    <releaseNotes>
  - Add -U/--notravcheck to skip double-traversal safety (for Google Drive FS)
  - Unified all simple packaging options under a single 'make package' call
  - Reduce code size on macOS by dropping some Linux-specific code

  This release is basically identical to 1.18.1, except for the new -U/--notravcheck option that was added to disable the double-traversal safety check. This fix has been added to enable recursion on Google Drive File Stream which returns the same device:inode pair for ALL directories for some strange reason. If you don't need -U, don't be in any rush to upgrade.
