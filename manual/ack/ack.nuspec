    <summary>ack is a code-searching tool, similar to grep but optimized for programmers searching large trees of source code. It runs in pure Perl, is highly portable, and runs on any platform that runs Perl.</summary>
    <description># ack is a tool like grep, optimized for programmers

Designed for programmers with large heterogeneous trees of source code, ack is written purely in portable Perl 5 and takes advantage of the power of Perl's regular expressions.

From: https://beyondgrep.com/changes.txt

v3.4.0      Mon Jun 29 23:04:18 CDT 2020
========================================
[FEATURES]
When calling "ack -c" to get a list of filenames and counts, the filename
would not be colored like when getting normal search results.  Now it will.
Thanks to Matthew Hughes for adding the feature, and Ophir Lifshitz for the
suggestion. (GH#282)

Added --toml for the TOML filetype. (GH#306)

[FIXES]
The test t/ack-x.t would fail when run as root. Now it is skipped. Thanks,
Michael LaGrasta. (GH#217)


v3.3.1      Mon Jan 13 10:27:16 CST 2020
========================================
[FIXES]
Some regexes would be shown as invalid when used with the -Q option.  Since
the -Q tells ack to treat the regex as a literal, this shouldn't be
possible.  (GH#294)


v3.3.0      Sat Dec 28 16:00:21 CST 2019
========================================
[FEATURES]
The error message ack displays when the regex passed is invalid has been
improved.  The message is more readable and includes a pointer to the
offending part of the regex.  For example:

    $ ack 'status: (open|closed|in progress'
    ack: Invalid regex 'status: (open|closed|in progress'
    Regex: status: (open|closed|in progress
                   ^---HERE Unmatched ( in regex

Added many new file and directory exclusions to speed up file selection.
* Python's *.pyc, *.pyd and *.pyo compiled files
* Python's \_\_pycache\_\_ and .pytest_cache directories
* Linux *.so shared object files
* Windows dynamic-link library *.dll files
* gettext compiled *.mo translation files
* macOS's \_\_MACOSX directories and .DS_Store files

Reorganized the --help menu to put "action" options like -f, -g and -l at
the top of the listing.

The --show-types option only has an effect with -f or -g.  ack will now
tell you if you use --show-types without -f or -g when it will have no
effect.

Improved the error message when ack gets passed two options that can't be
used together.


[FIXES]
Fixed the behavior of --break and --heading.  Using --break would
implicitly set --noheading, and --heading would implicitly set --nobreak.

The following pairs of options don't make sense to use together, and ack will now warn you if you try:

* -x and --files-from
* -v and -o
* -v and --output
* -v and --passthru

Fixed the minimum version of the Getopt::Long module required. (GH #287)

The line number and filename separators in --passthru mode now work the
same as in context (-A/-B/-C) mode.  (GH #291)


v3.2.0      Sun Nov  3 22:52:18 CST 2019
========================================
[FEATURES]
Added "-t X" as a short alias for --type=X.

Added "-T X" as a short alias for --type=noX.

The feature of using the name of the type as an option is deprecated.  For
example, ack currently lets you use "--perl" instead of "--type=perl" or
"-t perl",  This is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Removed support for Parrot (--parrot).


v3.1.3      Sat Oct 19 19:23:48 CDT 2019
========================================
No changes to functionality.  Fixed a problem with version numbers.
Thanks to Dan Book for his help.
See https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3/commit/b3c43d44109dea6ebc0753107a8e85a6b322f4ca


v3.1.2      Mon Oct 14 21:47:51 CDT 2019
========================================
[SPEEDUP]
Using -w with a pattern that ended with a metacharacter would be slower
than it should be because it would skip an optimization. Now it's fixed.
(GH #181, #251)

[FIXES]
Fixed test failures that would sometimes happen on Windows machines because
of taint mode.  Thanks, Tomasz Konojacki. (GH #235)

Remove the use of the version.pm module.


v3.1.1      Sat Aug 31 22:56:10 CDT 2019
========================================
[SPEEDUP]
Improved the speed up the -l, -L and -c options by pre-scanning the file
in bulk before doing line-by-line scan. (GH #221)

ack now uses File::Next 1.18 which calls stat() only once per file or
directory, instead of sometimes calling it twice.  This should improve the
time spent traversing directories.

[FIXES]
On Windows, patterns with $ to mark the end of the line would not match.
(GH #229)

[DOCUMENTATION]
Fixed docs that referred to --range-stop instead of --range-end. (GH #228)


v3.1.0      Thu Aug 22 22:43:15 CDT 2019
========================================
[FEATURES]
Added the --range-start and --range-end options to allow searching only
ranges of each file. (GH #165)


v3.0.3      Tue Aug 20 23:42:02 CDT 2019
========================================
[FIXES]
Made smartcase's check for lowercase patterns smarter.

[DOCUMENTATION]
Updated many URLs, especially in the config. (GH #223)


v3.0.2      Thu Jul  4 21:42:43 CDT 2019
========================================
[FIXES]
ack's smart-case feature would think that a pattern like "select \S+ from"
is looking for a uppercase letter, and so would not make a case-insensitive
search.  Now, ack knows that uppercase letters in metacharacters don't
count as looking for a uppercase letter. (GH #156, 187, 214)


v3.0.1      Tue Jun 25 20:47:58 CDT 2019
========================================
[FIXES]
The -s option tells ack not to complain about missing or unreadable files
it tries to search.  The -s option would not always work in conjection with
the -x option.  Now it does.  Thanks, Anders Eriksson and M. Scott Ford.
(GH #175)

ack would die if you specified a --output option that didn't use one
of Perl's special match variables.  Now it won't.  Thanks, M. Scott
Ford. (GH #210)

[INTERNALS]
Added a Dockerfile for use when working on ack development.  Thanks,
M. Scott Ford. (GH #208)
