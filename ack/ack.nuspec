    <summary>ack is a code-searching tool, similar to grep but optimized for programmers searching large trees of source code. It runs in pure Perl, is highly portable, and runs on any platform that runs Perl.</summary>
    <description>#ack 2.18 is a tool like grep, optimized for programmers

Designed for programmers with large heterogeneous trees of source code, ack is written purely in portable Perl 5 and takes advantage of the power of Perl's regular expressions.

====================================
ack 2.18 will probably be the final release in the ack 2.x series.
I'm going to be starting work on ack 3.000 in earnest.  Still,
if you discover problems with ack 2, please report them to
[https://github.com/petdance/ack2/issues](https://github.com/petdance/ack2/issues)

If you're interested in ack 3 development, please sign up
for the ack-dev mailing list and/or join the ack Slack.  See
[https://beyondgrep.com/community/](https://beyondgrep.com/community/) for details.

##[INTERNALS]
Removed the abstraction of App::Ack::Resource and its subclass
App::Ack::Resource::Basic.  We are abandoning the idea that we'll have
plugins.</releaseNotes>
